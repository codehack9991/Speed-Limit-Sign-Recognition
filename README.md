# Speed-Limit-Sign-Recognition

## Objective

Our aim was to make a real time speed limit sign recogntiton sytem for the geneva convention.
We used CTC (centroid to contour method) described in the paper 
   " Real-time embedded implementation of robust speed-limit sign recognition using a novel centroid-to-contour description method"
